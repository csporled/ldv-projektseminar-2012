README for RegestAnalyser

Directory structure:
./lib/		contains library files needed for the tools
./bin/		contains binary files of the toolchain and external tools

The following tools are provided within the toolchain:
Lemmatizer.jar		takes a verb form and gets lemmatized infinitive form from Wortschatz Leipzig online (German)
SyntaxTagger.jar	reads in text from stdin or database and invokes the berkeley parser on them.
SyntaxParser.jar	reads in berkeley parsed text from stdin or database, creates java objects and 
					stores those objects in a database.
					
The following libraries are provided within the lib/ directory:
dbManager.jar					provides a commonly used database manager.

Needed external libraries:
ObjectDB:
Some of the tools need database access. For this purpose the ObjectDB database management system is used.
(see http://www.objectdb.com/ for more information)
The following files are needed:
lib/converter.jar
lib/explorer.jar
lib/objectdb.jar
lib/objectdb-jee.jar

Apache CLI:
The Apache command line interface (CLI) is used by some of the tools.
The following file is needed:
lib/commons-cli.jar

Wortschatz Leipzig: Baseform:
The lemmatizer uses web tools provided by Leipzig University for project Deutscher Wortschatz.
(http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/ - website in German!)
This tool uses an internet connection to receive the base form of a given german verb.
The following file is needed:
lib/Baseform-complete-client.jar

Needed external binary files:
berkeley parser:
The syntaxParser tool uses the berkeley parser to parse the regest texts. For that purpose a grammar has been 
trained to tag syntactical and morphologigal information. Those files are provided in the bin/berkeleyParser directory.
The following files are needed:
bin/berkeleyParser/berkeleyParser.jar
bin/berkeleyParser/gerNegra.01.utf8
